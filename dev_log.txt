Open Education dev log

Running bug list
----------------
- when using the menu option to change page alignment (left, center, right) the selected
  object overlay (such as when editing an expresison) is not redrawn until the object is de-selected
  and re-selected
- on mac
    - resizing window does not trigger a re-layout/redraw event, looks quite broken until you scroll
- auto-cetner on maxize if the screen is large enough
    - alight right default was mostly because I developed this on a small screen
    - the align center happens too aggressively (I think the popup menu might be wider on mac)
    - also the menu option at the top still says align right after the automatic swithc to center
- check for unsved changes seems to be broken (on mac at least)
    - INVESTINGATE THIS SOON
    - might have something to do with the half-application half applet design
- when a new line is added upon modifying an expression if the expresison is in a group,
  the boundry of the group is not updated

Running cleanup/TODO
--------------------
- convert expresion parsing to ANTLR
- move various tree traversals to visitor pattern
- UNIT TESTS
    - most important tests all of the backend
        - where it is dependent on some front-end replace direct interface
          with a wrapper that can be mocked
            - Example : measuring text currently requires the GUI
                - I think I got around this by creating an image and
                  opening up a drawing context for it, can use this
                  same strategy for setting up the unit tests
                - can even check expression layout wiht this method
                - would be worth have an automated exact pixel check
                - as well as writing a basic interface to view
                  the expected layouts against the current generated
                  ones visually to approve major refactorings
- every time I adjust somehting with zoomLevel
    - is the rounding consistent when going back to pixels?
    - seeÂ DocViewerPanel.docPt2PanelPt
- clarify paste behavior
    - dont require page selection
- consider removing page selection all together
    - make it only happen when a user wants to add or delete a page
    - it just confuses people when the whole page turns blue
    - word processors do not have a delete page feature
- shove everything down command
    - allows for adding a new section to a large document
    - or moving content in general
- consider doing autmatic layout
    - absolute layout for diagrams in special drawing/diagram areas
        - like MS office text boxes
    - otherwise UI could be simplified and streaqmlined, just waitch between text and
      math modes
    - almost like a GUI latex editor
        - make smart choicese
            - allow expressions to appear in a sentence
            - if a user createa a multi-line expression separate it from the text
              and center it
                - as is done in Latex docs often
- ObjectProertiesFrame
    - get rid of all the hacks
    - keyboard shortcurts
        - currently have custom code in ObjectPropertyFrame creation
          to add teh keyboard listener to the relevant panel to allow
          keyboard shortcuts to be used immediately after switching
          to the solve tab (without clicking on the document again)

- spent a few hours fighting with Codeigniter
    - could not get sign in working on site again
- get the datbase set up
- debugged through the router, found a fix to the issue
  that it was re-routing to user/classes -> auth/login
    - then there was a redirect loop
    - rage quit
        - best thing to do in the future is probably 
          start with a fresh CodeIgnighter (I have played
          around in the path to get rid of the index.php in
          the URL among other things)
        - from there I can try to re-apply the application
          files into a clean installation
        - could look into upgrading to version 3.0

-------------
- working on OpenNotebook today
- overall project roadmap
    - try to get the pivot I worked on last year at 3ds put together
    - focus on student interface, as well as teacher grading/overview
    - de-emphasize or completely remove classroom content generation
- goals
    - test out interface for a while, taking notes about biggest
      annoyances in regards to the interface for solving problems
        - cannot use expression modifications keyboard shortcuts after
          clicking on solve tab
            - fixed - added a NotebookKeyboardListener to the second pane
              if the ObjectPropertiesFrame is being made for an
              ExpressioObject
        - substituting multiple variables is a pain
        - need to have one poup to substitue multiple at once
            - can use the list interface (once I can put objects in a 
              menu-ediatable list)
            - to make it mouse free
                - tab always brings you to the next thing
                    -  | var input | = | val input |
                    - tab brings you to the next input box
                        - or if you are in th last val input adds another
                    - enter submits
                    - make users type x= into a single box with val?
                        - would this be simpler or more complicated
                        - code both, have people try it out
        -
    - replace the parser with ANTLR
    - get the cursor integrated with the backend expression representation
    - serialize

- goals
    - generate student version of worksheet with answers and problem formulas stripped out
    - grade a directory full of documents using an answer key
        - assume everything is set up properly
        - later worry about error cases
            - wrong docs, not related to answer key

- tring to learn more about other projects in the space
    - spent some time with WebWork
        - Perl based course management
        - server side expression rendering and answer checks
        - pretty large feature set, has been around since 1995
        - might have missed it but did not see a lot of tests in the source
        - think there are a few system refactorings that would be helpful
        - hard to do without more tests
        - 3.0 version claims to be a pretty complete re-write
            - did not get this running, played around wtih something like the 2.7 UI
            - not bad, but I wrote a lot of notes about little usability problems
            - too much flexibility for problem writers seems to introduce inconsistencies
              from a strudent perspective
            - feedback all requires a trip to the server, some docs and code made it seem like
              they were looking at the new JS based client side projects for equation rendering
        - Might be a decent project to get invovled with eventually
        - right now it looks like the development is pretty hard to follow
            - not an active commuity
            - code seems relatively messy and tested mostly by brute force
            - case in point: https://github.com/openwebwork/webwork2/wiki/Testing-Webwork3
- Going back to Khan and Desmos projects
    - shared project: Mathquill
    - JS based GUI for editing math equations
        - loosely connected to latex, lots of functionality that doesn't require knowing it
            - still some aspects that require some knowledge of TeX
        - used by a lot of orgaizations
            - Khan Acdemy
            - Desmos
            - Lernosity
        - Many of them have UIs with buttons to create common symbols
            - some have pretty substatntial forks to get additional functionality like matrices
                - https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill/issues/332
                - sometimes the maintainer seems to be a bit of a purist
                - this is definitely a patch that should have been merged in some form last fall when
                  it was bought up
                - From Han the maintainer:
                    - my thoughts are that your code looks like a great, well-written, useful hack,
                      but one big aim I have on the dev branch is to reduce divergence from
                      "canonical" LaTeX (to the extent that exists...), and adding \matrix,
                      \pmatrix etc commands would be moving in the opposite direction.
                    - I understand his desire to make the output of the library compatible with
                      other tools, but I feel like that is driving the UX in some cases
                    - considering the majority of the consumers of the library, it would seem like
                      making the UX intuitive should be the primary goal, if there is demand from
                      a relatively silent part of the community that they want it to work well
                      for latex commands then this should probably be turned on as an option
    - Contribution ideas
        - a few open issues that would be intersting to take a stab at
            - Undo / Redo support
        - implement the feature I wanted to add when I was taking a look at Desmos
            - allow for searching form complex symbols through their natural language names
                - using drop-down auto-complete
                - allows for resolving the ambiguity of symbols, not sure if MathQuill tracks this
                    - the MathML community claims this as a major benefit over 
                      latex last time I looked at it

----------------------------------------------
Searching for a better digital math experience
----------------------------------------------
- tried this earilier
    - think I messed this up pretty badly, didn't notive the master branch was a year out of date
- Library used for the dropdown UI
    - ddslick
    - others to look at
        - chosen : http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
            - think I read somewhere this is really just for tet dropdowns
