Open Education dev log

Running bug list
----------------
- when using the menu option to change page alignment (left, center, right) the selected
  object overlay (such as when editing an expresison) is not redrawn until the object is de-selected
  and re-selected
- on mac
    - resizing window does not trigger a re-layout/redraw event, looks quite broken until you scroll
- auto-cetner on maxize if the screen is large enough
    - alight right default was mostly because I developed this on a small screen
    - the align center happens too aggressively (I think the popup menu might be wider on mac)
    - also the menu option at the top still says align right after the automatic swithc to center
- check for unsved changes seems to be broken (on mac at least)
    - INVESTINGATE THIS SOON
    - might have something to do with the half-application half applet design
- when a new line is added upon modifying an expression if the expresison is in a group,
  the boundry of the group is not updated

Running cleanup/TODO
--------------------
- convert expresion parsing to ANTLR
- move various tree traversals to visitor pattern
- UNIT TESTS
    - most important tests all of the backend
        - where it is dependent on some front-end replace direct interface
          with a wrapper that can be mocked
            - Example : measuring text currently requires the GUI
                - I think I got around this by creating an image and
                  opening up a drawing context for it, can use this
                  same strategy for setting up the unit tests
                - can even check expression layout wiht this method
                - would be worth have an automated exact pixel check
                - as well as writing a basic interface to view
                  the expected layouts against the current generated
                  ones visually to approve major refactorings
- every time I adjust somehting with zoomLevel
    - is the rounding consistent when going back to pixels?
    - seeÂ DocViewerPanel.docPt2PanelPt
- clarify paste behavior
    - dont require page selection
- consider removing page selection all together
    - make it only happen when a user wants to add or delete a page
    - it just confuses people when the whole page turns blue
    - word processors do not ahve a delete page feature
- shove everything down command
    - allows for adding a new section to a large document
    - or moving content in general
- consider doing autmatic layout
    - absolute layout for diagrams in special drawing/diagram areas
        - like MS office text boxes
    - otherwise UI could be simplified and streaqmlined, just waitch between text and
      math modes
    - almost like a GUI latex editor
        - make smart choicese
            - allow expressions to appear in a sentence
            - if a user createa a multi-line expression separate it from the text
              and center it
                - as is done in Latex docs often
- ObjectProertiesFrame
    - get rid of all the hacks
    - keyboard shortcurts
        - currently have custom code in ObjectPropertyFrame creation
          to add teh keyboard listener to the relevant panel to allow
          keyboard shortcuts to be used immediately after switching
          to the solve tab (without clicking on the document again)

- spent a few hours fighting with Codeigniter
    - could not get sign in working on site again
- get the datbase set up
- debugged through the router, found a fix to the issue
  that it was re-routing to user/classes -> auth/login
    - then there was a redirect loop
    - rage quit
        - best thing to do in the future is probably 
          start with a fresh CodeIgnighter (I have played
          around in the path to get rid of the index.php in
          the URL among other things)
        - from there I can try to re-apply the application
          files into a clean installation
        - could look into upgrading to version 3.0

- working on OpenNotebook today
- overall project roadmap
    - try to get the pivot I worked on last year at 3ds put together
    - focus on student interface, as well as teacher grading/overview
    - de-emphasize or completely remove classroom content generation
- goals
    - test out interface for a while, taking notes about biggest
      annoyances in regards to the interface for solving problems
        - cannot use expression modifications keyboard shortcuts after
          clicking on solve tab
            - fixed - added a NotebookKeyboardListener to the second pane
              if the ObjectPropertiesFrame is being made for an
              ExpressioObject
        - substituting multiple variables is a pain
        - need to have one poup to substitue multiple at once
            - can use the list interface (once I can put objects in a 
              menu-ediatable list)
            - to make it mouse free
                - tab always brings you to the next thing
                    -  | var input | = | val input |
                    - tab brings you to the next input box
                        - or if you are in th last val input adds another
                    - enter submits
                    - make users type x= into a single box with val?
                        - would this be simpler or more complicated
                        - code both, have people try it out
        -
    - replace the parser with ANTLR
    - get the cursor integrated with the backend expression representation
    - serialize
