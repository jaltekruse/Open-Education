Open Education dev log

Running bug list
----------------
- when using the menu option to change page alignment (left, center, right) the selected
  object overlay (such as when editing an expresison) is not redrawn until the object is de-selected
  and re-selected
- on mac
    - resizing window does not trigger a re-layout/redraw event, looks quite broken until you scroll
- auto-cetner on maxize if the screen is large enough
    - alight right default was mostly because I developed this on a small screen
    - the align center happens too aggressively (I think the popup menu might be wider on mac)
    - also the menu option at the top still says align right after the automatic swithc to center
- check for unsved changes seems to be broken
    - INVESTINGATE THIS SOON

Running cleanup/TODO
--------------------
- convert expresion parsing to ANTLR
- move various tree traversals to visitor pattern
- UNIT TESTS
    - most important tests all of the backend
        - where it is dependent on some front-end replace direct interface
          with a wrapper that can be mocked
            - Example : measuring text currently requires the GUI
                - I think I got around this by creating an image and
                  opening up a drawing context for it, can use this
                  same strategy for setting up the unit tests
                - can even check expression layout wiht this method
                - would be worth have an automated exact pixel check
                - as well as writing a basic interface to view
                  the expected layouts against the current generated
                  ones visually to approve major refactorings

- spent a few hours fighting with Codeigniter
    - could not get sign in working on site again
- get the datbase set up
- debugged through the router, found a fix to the issue
  that it was re-routing to user/classes -> auth/login
    - then there was a redirect loop
    - rage quit
        - best thing to do in the future is probably 
          start with a fresh CodeIgnighter (I have played
          around in the path to get rid of the index.php in
          the URL among other things)
        - from there I can try to re-apply the application
          files into a clean installation
        - could look into upgrading to version 3.0

- working on OpenNotebook today
- overall project roadmap
    - try to get the pivot I worked on last year at 3ds put together
    - focus on student interface, as well as teacher grading/overview
    - de-emphasize or completely remove classroom content generation
- goals
    - test out interface for a while, taking notes about biggest
      annoyances in regards to the interface for solving problems
        - cannot use expression modifications keyboard shortcuts after
          clicking on solve tab
        - substituting multiple variables is a pain
        - need to have one poup to substitue multiple at once
            - can use the list interface (once I can put objects in a 
              menu-ediatable list)
            - to make it mouse free
                - tab always brings you to the next thing
                    -  | var input | = | val input |
                    - tab brings you to the next input box
                        - or if you are in th last val input adds another
                    - enter submits
                    - make users type x= into a single box with val?
                        - would this be simpler or more complicated
                        - code both, have people try it out
                - 
    - replace the parser with ANTLR
    - get the cursor integrated with the backend expression representation
    - serialize
