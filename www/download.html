	Creating mathematical documents no longer has to be a laborious task.
        Our new application, Open Notebook, provides the prefect level of flexibility.
        You can easily add all of the geometirc shapes, graphs, equations and number lines
        that are needed for mathematical documents. The interface is straightforward, and
        provides only the tools that are needed for math teachers. Never again will you
        have to search through the endless feature sets of word processors that are
        designed to do everything, or try to learn a markup language with hundreds of tags. </p>
	<p>In addition to making documents for print, Open Notebook provides tools to
        make your worksheets interactive. The student mode of Open Notebook allows for the assignments to be completed digitally.  We will soon release a web service for teachers and students to share these documents.  This will enable teachers to promptly and easily analyze their students' performance on each assignment to identify trouble spots and better prepare for class the next day.
	</p>
	<p>Your future of a more productive school day, and more time to spend helping
        your students awaits.
