OpenCalc Tutorial:
------------------

I. The calculator
    A. Basic Calculations
        The input box below the large white panel is used to type
        calculations. When you want to evaluate an expression you can hit
        enter, or click the solve button. The large white panel displays
        the calculation history. Previous entries are listed after the >
        character, with calculated values displayed without any special
        line indicators.

   B. Variable Usage
        If you wish to store a value for recall later you can use the "="
        operator. This is used for assignment using the format:
        "variableName = 5" or "variableName = (7*8)^3". The variable name
        must come first.

   C.Creating variables
        You can use any of the existing variables available in the Vars tab,
        or type your own variable names into the terminal to create them,
        using the format described above. They must begin with an underscore
        or a letter, and all of the subsequent characters can be numbers,
        letters or underscores. Variable names are case sensitive.
        Examples of correct names: x, x2, sizeOfBall, _val, num_of_marbles
        Examples of incorrect names: 2x, x-2, &d, #3, 

   D. Sorting Variables
        The calculator includes a system for organizing your variables. In
        the Vars tab you can see a list of available groups. By deselecting 
        a check box next to a group you can remove the buttons from the list
        below. This does not disable the use of the variable in the terminal,
        it just allows you to shorten the list of variable buttons. To make
        a new group, type the name into the box on the variable menu and hit
        the "make/set". Variables can also be created or reassigned in the same
        fashion by filling in the appropriate fields.
 
   E. Calculation History
        To recall a previous entry you can use the up/down arrows on your
        keyboard. Keep in mind that the list does not loop. Once you hit
        the first entry it will stop. All text boxes next to a small
        button with a down arrow have a history. You can open/close it by
        clicking on the buttons, or by using the up/down arrows.
