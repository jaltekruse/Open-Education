OpenCalc is a new initiative to change the way mathematics education works. Students will be able to record symbolic mathematical work through an intuitive drag and drop interface and save it digitally. Using the same system, teachers will be able to easily generate problems sets to share with students. If teachers desire they will be able to write symbolic solution methods to their problems, allowing assignments to be graded by the software itself. This would mean while students are doing homework, they could be given instant verbose feedback. When students are given tests, the software could grade them and even assign partial credit by looking at the work students did to arrive at their answers. Future goals include creating a online database of problem sets that teachers will be able to contribute to and pull from. We hope to get a first year algebra curriculum created as a proof of concept. In addition it will provide all of the standard features of a graphing calculator.
