Goals:
    - many of the objectives of Open Education were similar to the Webwork project
        - emphasises open source technology
        - teacher created problem formulas
        - shared problem database
        - web frontend for classroom management
    - I want to better familiarize myself with:
        - the history of the project
        - current feature set
        - difficulty of hosting
        - do some performance benchmarks with simulated workloads
        - get an idea of the code quality and community acivity level
        - could this be a viable option for the web portion of my efforts?
        - is my frontend a good candidate for integration with Webwork?
            - I think dragmath has been integrated with this or a similar project
    - Key differences to learn more about
        - focus on univerity courses
        - can/are high schools also adopting it?
        - how can it be made more approachable for high schools?

Ideas:
    - There is a large database of problems that appears to be a bit of a pain to access
        - need to find out how easy it is to navigate this "database"
        - is there a simple service that could leverage this database?
        - maybe just a worksheet generator?
            - no need for web setup

--------------------------------------------------------------
Taking a look at the UI using the virtual machine installation
- http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Installing_from_WW2.9_Ubuntu14.04_Vanilla_Virtual_Machine_Image#.VXosLKbfg7w
--------------------------------------------------------------
- forgotten package in the distro
    - sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
    - what does this package do?
        - live tex? Is it a gui tex editor?
- signing into the site at: localhost/webwork2
    - could not really find a Wiki page as a getting started with the site
    - the URL auto-completed upon typing localhost into the browser address bar
- didn't know the password to sign in, might be hidden in the wiki somewhere
    - admin/admin
- trying out the first problem set
    - at the top there is a set of nav buttons
        - Prev, Up, Next
            - what does up do?
            - gets you back to the list of problems
            - not sure users would get this
    - entered a word into a text box, clicked "check answers"
        - there was only one answer box
    - this showed me in a grid:
        - the text I entered
        - a "rendered" version
            - it wasn't an expression so it wasn't really needed here
                - although writing a word or sentence as an answer in math is rare
                - maybe this shouldn't be the case, but that is for another day
        - result : correct
    - overall a little clunky of a UI, but the info would generally be useful
        - might look better just in a Web 2.0 approved set of divs
        - current web dev shuns unneeded grids
    - confusing bit was this in red at the top
        - "ANSWERS ONLY CHECKED -- ANSWERS NOT RECORDED"
            - I did not see a record answer button
            - this also should not be possible, if I am checking my answer it should require
              a trip to the server, and then it should just send the answer
        - found this down further in the page, I guess this is why I can't submit
            - "You have attempted this problem 0 times. This homework set is closed."
        - It seems like check answers might actually submit to the server, but as the
          problem set was closed it didn't save the answer
            - not the craziest behavior, but it did make me think they should have a greyed out
              "submit answer" button, which seem unceccesary as it should just be a single step
            - this made it seem like it was supposed to be two steps but the second was missing
            - could just be fixed with a different mesage:
                - As the problem set has been closed, your answer was not recorded.
    - second problem has three parts
        - same word as before (it asks the user to fill in  ______________ world!)
        - basic addition
        - and a basic derivative
    - if I want to make this approchable to high schools I'll need a simpler intro exam
    - multipart answer overview in the grid looks a little more reasonable with more answers
        - still might look better outside of a grid
    - next is multiple choice
        - requires typing the letter in a box rather than just using a radio button?
            - take this back a little as the next question has a radio button
                - why have the other option at all?
                - confirmed it was not asking for several options or anything weird
                - "Enter the letter corresponding to the correct answer:" ______________
        - just a little nitpick, but could be easily improved a little
        - checkboxes could even support intuitive "choose all that are correct" questions
            - I assume this must be done with a comma separated bit of text if this is how
              single answer multiple choice is done
    - matching
        - based on numbers/letters and text boxes
            - "optimiation" possible with some jquery drag and drop
        - original problem
            Place the letter of the derivative next to each function listed below:  
            ___ 1. 5x^4
            ___ 2. \sin(3x)
            ___ 3. 4x^4
            ___ 4. \tan(x)

            A. \sec^2(x)
            B. 3\cos(3x)
            C. 20x^{3}
            D. 16x^{3}

        - this was a little confusing it said:
            - print the questions again, but insist that the first two questions 
              (about sin and cos) always be included. Here is a second way to format this question, using tables: 
            - neither the list of derivatives nor the functions has both sine and cosine
                - little nitpicky, they could just say the ones with the trig funtions instead
                - should look at the problem formula to see how to specify this
            - the tables thing seems unnecessary, might want to see if there are problems making good use
              of features like this or if they could be hidden away or removed entirely to make it simpler
        - There was a useful note at the bottom
            - "Note: You can earn partial credit on this problem."
            - as there are multiple independent questions I think this should be expected
        - the last example showed a similar problem in a grid again but with a
          "The derivative is not provided" option
        - grading
            - nitpick again showed my plain text (this time just individual characters) as rendered "Answer Preview"s
    - True/false
        - must enter t or f
            - just make it a radio button (or drop down?)
                - next one is just a drop down, no reason to have the first one
            - works for both mouse and keyboard
            - take a look at accessiblity guidlines, I'm guessing it would be easier for the visually
              impared using screen readers to have the correct UI elements
    - embedded "On-the-fly" grpahics
        - this is a bit confusing, to enable text answer input there is a good amount of indirection
            - the graph is tiny and can be enlarged in a second window b clicking on it
                - how well does this work with mobile?
                - if opened multiple times the windows appear to replace each other
                    - but they actually overlap and are staying around
            - the colors are given letter for providing answers
                - simple matching UI could help here as well
                    - hope these problems are written in such a way that this UI could be
                      leveraged by a lot of problems if it was written properly
                - particularly annoying that blue is not represented by B at least
        - graph with 3 functions on it
        - Identify the graphs A (blue), B( red) and C (green) as the graphs of a function 
           and its derivatives (click on the graph to see an enlarged image):
            ____ is the graph of the function
            _____ is the graph of the function's first derivative
            _____ is the graph of the function's second derivative 
    - more on the fly graphics
        - more matching, each matching answer has a graph to open
        - thought I couldn't open several popup windows to look at the big graphs side by side
            - I was using the new "web" behavior of clicking off the popup windows
                - as is often the case with page internal popus these days where the screen greys-out
                  to emphasize a popup on the page
                - really the window manager was just putting the popup window behind my main browser window
                - maybe to be more consistent with other site this could close the windows, but that clashes
                  with traditional window managers
                    - in this case the "big" images are small enough that they should just be shown
                      full size on the problem answering screen
                        - responsive UI and possibly allowing users to move these image around could help here
                        - in this case I am comparing the graphs but they are separated on the page
    - more on the fly graphics
        - talks about how these were generated using extensions you can install
        - We have developed other ways to specify graphs which are to be created 
          'on the fly'. All of these new methods consist of adding macro packages
          to WeBWorK. Since they do not require the core of WeBWorK to be changed,
          these enhancements can be added by anyone using WeBWorK. 
        - should find out how these macro packages work
        - first question
            - asks for an expression fragment
                - a bit of an ugly text box inside of an expression is shown, the expression they need
                  is simple, but this could easily become a pain to enter larger expressions
                - seems like even taking a trip to the server out of the equation for "previwing answers"
                  and instead rendering locally would be useful
                    - this should be possible with mathjax or mathquill
            - next asks for points
                - "List the internal local minimum points in increasing order: :"
                - doesn't give an expected format (althought the standard easily fits into ASCII)
                - could be enahced with some javascript with grayed out text (x, y)
                - local minima do not appear to be on integer values, or even close to factors of halves
                    - the grid provided is static and only shows at integer steps
                - tried to grade my order pair, it complained:
                    - Your answer isn't a number (it looks like a list of numbers)
                    - there should be a well designed list of answer types
                        - seems like the grading system knowns about this
                        - the student UI should be enahanced to tell them what type
                          of answer is expected before htting grade
                        - using the "preview answers" feature will redner the math, but not give these
                          contextual messages
                            - it will only report syntax errors
    - linking to external resources
        - both links catured in the problem text are no longer valid
            - The requested page "/mathland/mathtrek_5_15_00.html" could not be found. 
            - The requested URL /webwork2_course_files/myTestCourse/calc.html was not found on this server.
                - this may require some additional setup on my part
                - but this should probably be done automatically especailly on the demo image
        - talks about resources stored in the same directory as the problem
            - shows a graph
            - shwos 3 graphs formatting in a grid
            - they really like their grids
            - I assume these are static?
                - should figure out how the dynamic graphs are generated, where they sit on the server
            - noticed a bunch of data in the URL bar
                - including user, effectiveUser and something called key
                - I should check for security issues here
                - I doubt that there are any, but if nothing else the URLs could be cleaned up
                    - after taking a look at the db schema it might be useful to see how these could be minimized
                    - could there be a link to problem # 10 on a particular quiz that would work for anyone
                      with access?
                    - looks like this is kind of already the case
                        - myTestCourse/MAAtutorial/12/
                    - although they mix this with key/value URL value encoding which could probably be simplified
                        - ?user=admin&effectiveUser=admin&
                        key=W2bFZuS9s7H2iKtmr6oP9dbkcrc7Bujb
                        &theme=&displayMode=images&showOldAnswers=1
    - timed out an was redirected to login
        - it sent me back to where I was
        - expected, but nice to see it is correct
    - JavaScript Example 1
        - broken link to calculator again
            - not sure what they expect students to do with a general purpose calculator to help them with this problem
                - maybe try out different brute force formulas for the function
        - problem features a pre-baked "calculator" that will give a output of an unknwn f(x) given a value of x
        - interesting idea but I noticed a few issues
            - it does not let me put math in the input box, 3+5 fails and gives NaN
                - this could be improved to be a string that would be clearer for most people
            - if you hit enter when you are in the box it will go to the "preview answer" screen
                - This might make sense, but in this case I hadn't actually put in an answer
                  and the box I was in was not for inputting an answer
                - it requires I click the button to make the answer appear in the result box
                    - the behavior upon pressing enter is really non-intuitive, at least doing
                      nothing would make me click the button rather than wonder why the page refreshed
                        - it is clear that it isn't just a refresh as the grid with the "answer preview" is
                          added at the top, but this is confusing as it is just tow empty boxes in the grid
                - might want to separate these forms
                    - don't know if this is possible without JS as the one form is embedded in what I assume
                      is a problem wide form for the case where there are multiple answer boxes
                    - although at this point JS is nearly a requirement for much of the web
                    - should see if the project lists graceful degradation in the case of no JS or other
                      limited environments as a goal
                        - cutting out support for old browsers could allow for more interesting features sooner
        - problem text:
        - Find the derivative of the function f(x). 
          The windows below will tell you the value of f for any input x.
          (I call this an "oracle function", since if you ask, it will tell.) 
        - possible bug in the problem
            - asks for the derivative
            - the input box is labelled - f'(2) = _______________________
            - not sure if it wants a formula or a number?
        - solving the problem - this seems really hard, I can't figure out the pattern
            - f(1) = 1.2
            - f(5) = 66
            - f(10) = 282
            - f(15) = 648
    - next js example
        - again the oracle function
            - as it talks about JS I assume this is all evaluated client side
                - it is in the page as un-obfuscated JS, not a real issue as I think if anything
                  the system could use more client side processing
                - some may see this as a cheating risk, but I still believe paper exams should
                  represent the bulk of the grade awarded in any math class
    - next one just had matching and embedded graphs
    - problem 16 - conditional questions example
        - nothing too interesting, seems like you are able to generate a formula and
          a related prompt for an answer, in this case a derivative evaluated at a point
        - tried to submit my answer, did not realize from the layout that there was a part 2
            - said I got part 1 right and showed me part 2
            - went back to the original problem to see why I missed part 2
                - it wasn't there!
            - it wanted me to submit part 1
                - they re-used the generic interface for grading a multi-part problem, but did
                  not exclude the second part, which I had not seen or been given the opportunity
                  to answer
                - it said it was incorrect
                - but below it there was a message: "1 of the questions remains unanswered."
                - only after it shows the first part with my previous answer filled in does it say
                - "Right! Now try the second part of the problem: "
                - might seem nitpicky, but it should not say it was wrong at all
                    - seems like it should be able to grade part of a problem
                    - might just be an outdated tutorial, should see if a problem can be set up
                      like this without the confusing behavior
        If f(x) = 18 x + 15, find f'( -5 ). 
        _______________
    - problem 17 - embedded java
        - link to "mathbean applet" is broken
            - http://math.hws.edu/mathbeans/applets/index.html
        - file a request to have the link updated to this, seems to be the right project
            - http://math.hws.edu/~mitchell/mathbeans/
        - need to install Java inside the VM to make this work
            - couldn't get it to install, don't feel like messing around with it for now

- problem set screen
    - list of problems with the following properties
        - name
        - attempts (number)
        - remaining (attempts I guess? Example problem set lists unlimited for each question)
        - worth (number)
        - status (shown as percent)
    - at the bottom of the list, two buttons
        - email instructor
        - Download PDF or Tex hardcopy for Current Set

- download PDF screen
    - "Select the homework sets for which to generate hardcopy versions. 
       You may also select multiple users from the users list. 
       You will receive hardcopy for each (set, user) pair."
    - two columns for options relating to sets and users
        - users
            - choose sort order, default last_name, first_name
                - other options, user_id, email, student_id
                - some look less useful: comment, status, section, recitation?
            - format
                - last_name, first_name (user_id)
            - filer
                - only option is "Display all possible records"
                - looks like a multi-select box
            - button for "Change Display Settings"
                - all I can tell it does is refresh the page
                    - changes to the fields are preserved, maybe it saves this subset of the form without
                      submitting it to generate the PDF
        - sets
            - this is a little confusing because the button I pressed to get here said
              "for the Current Set" explicitly
            - is it talking about problems within the set, or is the button not filling in info in
              the form that it should?
            - looks like it did select the set name corresponding the the previous page I was on
            - not super obvious as it uses the stock multi-select window no one is familiar with
                - should replace this with the chosen.js or similar library
            - this should remove the need to configure any of this stuff, as it applies to multiple sets
            - should see if this can generate for multiple classes relatively painlessly
                - seems much more useful than generating a hardcopy of wor across problem sets
                    - maybe if the prof wanted to review the last few assignments, but here it
                      looks like it makes them ask for all users explicitly
                        - definitely should make it easy to get a whole class if anything
                    - this would be way more useful if it could record students intermediate work
            - fields it requests
                - sort order
                    - tons of options here, it looks like every property provided in the database
                    - should see how this works on the server, hope they aren't taking input from
                      the user and using it to generate a SQL query
                        - even if it was escaped it is pretty messy
                    - it even includes properties like: Field - hide word, Field - hide_score
                        - I assume these are just booleans, pretty much worthless to "sort" on
                - format
                    - default: set_id
                - Filter
                    - again single value in multi-select: Display all possible records
                - change display settings button
                    - again just looks to refresh the page
                - multi-select with problem set names
                    - what about problem set reuse across semesters? Or between classes?
                    - this might be localized to the current class/session
                        - cross class output would probably be useful as mentioned above
        - bottom of the form (outside of the users and sets columns)
            - Show (check boxes)
                - Student answers, correct answers, hints, solutions
                - difference between correct answers and solutions?
                    - for the example problem set I see "correct answers" listed for each problem
                    - inconsistent: Answers(s) submitted, Correct Answers
                        - even if there is only one correct answer
                    - no mention of Solutions on the generated document
        - results
            - this was at the top, should see where this problem set description comes from, didn't notice
              it going through the web interface as a student answering questions
                - Welcome to the MAA short course on WeBWorK.
                  Here is a synopsis of the tutorial examples presented in this set.
                  They have been designed for learning the PG language, and are
                  not necessarily the best questions to use for mathematics instruction.
            - This was at the end of the summary of the problems, nice summary of the goals
              and limitations of the system
                - The primary purpose of WeBWorK is to let you know if you are 
                  getting the right answer or to alert you if you get the wrong
                  answer. Usually you can attempt a problem as many times as you
                  want before the due date. However, if you are having trouble
                  figuring out your error, you should consult the book, or ask a
                  fellow student, one of the TA’s or your professor for help. Don’t
                  spend a lot of time guessing – it’s not very efficient or effective.
                  The computer has NO CLUE about WHY your answer is wrong. Computers
                  are good at checking, but for help go to a human.
            - they really need to watch using computer science/programming jargon
                - Give 4 or 5 significant digits for (floating point) numerical answers.
                - no one will understand this "clarification" without having learned to program
                - if this is universal throughout the system, it certainly should be configurable
                - the default should probably be less than 5 as well
            - the problems
                - formatted pretty close to how they were on the web page
                    - obviously not being rendered by the web browser engine, so there are some issues
                      and formatting glitches
                    - most of the content is there and readable
                - answers are given in plain text, problems show rendered equations
                - it even gets the graphs inserted into the document, pretty nice
        - results - selecting more students
            - took a while
                - wonder if it was time spent hitting the database
                    - it is just a local mysql server, but I have an SSD, even going through a VM for a list
                      of 8 or so students I don't think it should have taken so long
                    - even generating fora  single user takes little bit, probably startup time for the 
                      PDF rendering process, but 8 students took at least a few minutes
                        - considering they aren't even getting a perfect doc out of it, maybe they should
                          just generate a webpage and let client browsers render it
                        - does printing from a webpage work well with mathjax and other UI elements?
            - generated 80 pages
            - they were separated out by student
                - it didn't put all of the answers to problem 1 together
                - think this alternative arrangement would be better 
                    - for grading objectively if they were manually re-grading a problem
                    - also for getting an overview of what went wrong if a bunch of students
                      got answers incorrect
            - seemed to be lacking an option to filter by just work that was incorrect
                - printing everything seems like a waste

- "Demo" problem set
    - first problem
        - asks for an order pair in two separate boxes for the x-coordinate and y-coordinate
            - maybe there isn't a complete library of answer types that can be specified by
              problem authors, if this is the demo they should be showing off features
    - second problem
        - evaluating limits
        - answers are numbers
        - there is a note
            - Note: Enter 'DNE' if the limit does not exist or is not defined. 
            - seems likely to be an indication that there are hacks in problem formulas
              to check for special strings in cases like this
            - should not force problem authors to be programmers
                - can have a check box with a description
                - either or answering methods (in this case a text box or the DNE solution)
                - seems likely to be an issue where it would complain about case if the
                  formula was written wrong
                    - this really just isn't the right UI for this type of input
    - third problem
        - have to enter an expression in text
        - give the option to see solution
            - opening solution it seems to appear at the wrong part of the page
              even though the "solution" button appeared before the second part of the problem
              the solution box was shown after it
        - second problem also can show solution, this box moves down after the first box has been opened
            - saved some screenshots in dropbox
    - forth problem
        - integrals, entering more complex expressions in plain text
        - "Give a specific function for F(x)."
            - seems like they don't want + C
        - didn't get it right on the first try, used wolfram alpha to get the answer
            - it didn't like how I input it
            - Wolfram alpha input : integrate (x^4) * sin(x^5)
                - answer: -(1/5) cos(x^5) + C
            - input given to Webwork
                - -(1/5)cos(x^5)
                - incorrect
            - also asked to evaluate a bounded integral
                - it said in the earlier problem set that I could put an expression in for a number
                    - so I just plugged in my limits into the formula I had for the first part of the problem
                      (it was the same integral)
                    - seemed to evaluate it (althoug I guess the formula was wrong
                     
                    Entered:        -(1/5)*cos(x^5) 
                    Answer Preview: -\frac{1}{5}\cos\!\left(x^{5}\right)
                    Result:         incorrect

                     Entered:        0.0186453659631881  
                     Answer Preview: -\frac{1}{5}\cos\!\left(5^{5}\right)-\frac{1}{5}\cos\!\left(-1^{5}\right)
                     Result:         incorrect
                - I wonder which of these (the formula or evaluated number) it will show to the instructor
                    - I assume it stores the plain text somewhere
                    - this behavior definitely would not be desirable for some lower level math courses
            - shows warnings (in a big red box) at the bottom of the page
            - this output would not be useful to most instructors

    - fifth problem
        - seems to actually not have enough information to answer the question:
        - its just a demo problem for instuctors, but it still should be accurate
        - Two perpendicular sides of a triangle are 3.2 m and 5.4 m long respectively.
          What is the length of the third side of the triangle? 
            - doesn't say right triangle, even if it assumed it, perpendicular doesn't mean they are the two
              legs of the right triangle
                - it could be the hypotenuse and one leg
        - it gives a hint to say use the pathagrean theorem
            - (Instructor hint preview: show the student hint after 0 attempts.
               The current number of attempts is 0. )
               Remembering the Pythagorean theorem A^2 +B^2 = C^2,
               you can enter sqrt(3.2^2 + 5.4^2) m or 6.28 m or 627.69 cm or ... 
        - This is just trying to demonstrate features but the question should be updated for accuracy
        - checking correct answer
            - "Your answer doesn't look like a number with units"
    - 6th problem
        - embedded image
        - projectile problem, throwing a basketball
        - small text alignment issue, screenshot in dropbox folder
    - 7th problem
        - determining which graph is a function, its derivative and second derivative
            - again with the slightly annoying indirection of the popup window to actually see the graph
            - also answering just uses text boxes where you have to give a letter which corresponds to a
              color on the graph
    - 8th problem
        - oracle funtion again, looks like these two demo's share a lot, they should probably just
          be combined
        - one new observation, probably was in the other version of this problem as well
        - "WeBWorK can use existing JavaScript and Java code to augment its capabilities."
            - should look into this
            - how is this done?
                - most of the project is in perl
            - how is it being used today?
            - should look at how I could use this in combination with JCM or the CAS in 
              geogebra for additional functionality
    - Few more problems
        - java applet
        - custom answer checking, palendrome checker example

Problem set 0:
    - first problem has a nice overview of how to enter numeric answers
    - first answer box restricts use of functions
        - students must just enter an answer
        - will be useful for Algebra classes, where teachers want students to learn to manually
          plug in numbers to get a final answer
    - supported conviniences normally available
        - Webwork supports functions like sin and sqrt
        - exponents with caret or **
        - multiplication by juxtaposition 

Creating a problem set:
    - the submit form button says "Take Action!"
        - this was confusing
    - first step, enter a name
        - get back a pretty cryptic error, it looks like just a system failure is being used to report
          input validation errors
            - I just put a space in the problem set name and it didn't like that
        - with simple "errors" like this instructing users to contact a webmaster this would
          be a real pain to manage an installation of
            - should investigate further
                - fuzz all forms
                - think of anything that could break upon invalid user input or non-typical navigation
        - it says
            - WeBWorK error

            An error occured while processing your request.

        - message from server done, back to notes
        - after set creation, it just brings me back to the list of all of the problem sets
            - should instead open the editing interface, why would a user create a problem set and not
              want to add anything to it?
        - looks like "Take Action" might be a ppor attempt to have a generalize form button that is more
          "descriptive" than just saying submit
            - this would probably just be clearer anyway, but the code reuse isn't worth it regardless
            - the forms should just have their own messages
        - the edit interface just allows adjusting properies visible, eanble EC, open/due/answer dates
        - hidden on the left is a hyperlink to "edit" the set
            - I just clicked a link that was supposed to make me edit it...
            - this just took me to a longer form for set properties
                - new options privided here
                - reduced credit enabled
                    - assume this decreases credit with each wrong answer
                - "Restrict release by set(s)"
                    - don't understand what this does, no subtext and the input is
                      just a bare textfield
                - Score required for release - default 100%
                    - not sure what this means
                - Hide Hints from Students
                    - not sure why you would even write hints
                    - might be to supress them if you use someone elses sets
                - assignment type
                    - should look into how these classifications can be used in
                      conjunction with the gradebook and composite score calculation
                    - is it flexible for what instructors want?
                - set description
                - set headers
                    - allows for setting different headers for the "Set" and hardcopy
                    - there is an "edit" button that brings user to a text box with latex in it
                        - need to find all of these and hide them if I want this usable by teachers
                            - can leave in the option to edit some parts of the source latex
                            - but it should be clear what is needed, here a line for the text of
                              the header would be fine
                    - there is also a view button that just brings the user to the make a hardcopy
                      screen
                        - where is the "set header" used if it is different from the hardopy one
                        - I was a little wrong
                            - the view page for the hardcopy one brought me to the page to configure
                            - the view for the other one was actually bringing me to the page to view
                              all of the problems in a list on the webpage
                                - it was a little confusing because the set was empty and all I could
                                  see was the "generate hardcopy" button, which would have brought
                                  me to the same place the other "view header" link did
                                - it did show the text "This homework set contains no problems."
                                    - as a substitute for where problems should have been
            - how do I add problems to the set?
                - at the bottom of the form is a small form element to add problems to the set
                - [ x ] "Add _____ blank problem template(s) to end of homework set"
                    - on the left that is a checkbox
                - hiting save on the whole form applies this action
                    - this doesn't seem very intuitive
                    - also I don't see an easy way to add problems from the library
                        - do people just copy and paste the latex?
                        - maybe after adding blank problems I'll be able to swap them out for one
                          from the library
                        - TODO - add info about the interface provided once a blank problem has
                          been added
                            - can generate several problems
                            - TODO - add more here
                        - editing a problem
                            - "demo" blank problem for entering pi
                            - lots of extra jargon in the basic problem
                            - commented out code
                - bit of a confusing interface, this definitly should be more interactive
        - figured out why I was confused
            - the path I took the first time allows for bulk editing multiple sets
            - editing a single set should defintely be the default easy path
            - bulk edit ca be useful, but it wasn't even clear that was what it was letting me do
            - there are checkboxes, but if I select only one it should just bring me to the single
              set form, as it has more complete options
            
Looking at the problem library
- Algebra
    - 
        - Library/ma117DB/set1b/srw1_6_1.pg
            - Express the sum of 4 consecutive integers in terms of the first integer n of them. 
            - answer: $ans1 = "$a*n+($a*($a-1))/2";
            - I guessed: n+(n+1)+(n+2)+(n+3)
                - I think this is also right, but it does a hard function comparison against
                  the students answer
                    - I think this is just a bad question, need to watch out for these
