<h2>Sharing Policy<h2/>
<p>
Open-Math is a service designed to make the lives of teachers easier. One of the key features it offers to achieve this goal simple document sharing. Like many similar social media and file sharing sites, content can be shared with just a few clicks. We hope that this new distribution system will enable teachers to build more adaptive and current curricula to meet the demands of our changing world, instead of relying on large centralized resources like textbooks.

<p>
With this in mind, teachers will need the resources they find on our site available to them for use in future classes. <b>For this reason we have instituted a site-wide no "un-sharing" policy.</b> Unlike social networks or blogs, when you remove a document from your account, any you have shared it with will still have access to it. If you decide to remove a colleague, unlike Facebook and other social networks, any documents you have shared with them in the past will still be accessible to them.

<p>
We want to make this very clear early on, our intention is not to take choice away from content producers, but to prevent unintended use of the site. If we allowed users to revoke access, some users would likely download any shared documents to prevent losing them, at which point they would just re-upload them to the site. We cannot check every upload against the existing database for uniqueness, so anything that is uploaded by a user is assumed to be their own creation, or something they have permission to re-distribute as they see fit (uploading anything else is strictly against our Terms of Service and can lead to suspension or deactivation of your account). Users will be responsible for sharing content only with users that understand if they are allowed to re-distribute them or not. If you do not want something to be public, we reccomend sharing with only users you know personally and that understand if you want your documents to stay out of the public database.
